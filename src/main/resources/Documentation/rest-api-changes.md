### <a id="post-verify"> Post Verify

__POST__ /changes/{change-id}/revisions/{revision-id}/@PLUGIN@~verifications

with the same job name.

The verification must be provided in the request body as a
[VerifyInput](#verify-input) entity.

#### Request

  POST /changes/myProject~master~I8473b95934b5732ac55d26311a706c9c2bde9940/revisions/674ac754f91e64a0efb8087e59a176484bd534d1/verify-status~verifications HTTP/1.0

another for the argument parser inside the Gerrit server.
