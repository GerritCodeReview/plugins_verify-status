      "message": "Now that you are using 2 to indicate a state this is no longer accurate.  \n\nThis metadata was intended to store job results.  I\u0027m wondering if it  even makes sense to mix job results with job states?  State seems like it should be a new column in the db?  It could indicate \"in progress\", \"hung\", \"aborted\", \"not built\", etc..\n\nWas wondering what you guys think?",

      "message": "With Jenkins CI as a reference \"aborted\" and \"not built\" are just another job results http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/model/Result.html. And that makes sense because they are all mutual exclusive so there is no absolute need to categorize them differently. As for \u0027in-progress\u0027 itself it\u0027s not supported as explicit result yet on jenkins side but eventually it seems to be just another candidate for Result enum similar to NOT_BUILT (which literally is not result). So I prefer jenkins way and keep everything under the same variable. \"hung\" is just endless in-progress so I don\u0027t think there will be a need for unique result value for it.",
